# User Management System (Node.js CRUD Application)

## Project Overview

This is a simple **User Management System** built with **Node.js** that allows users to **Add**, **Update**, **Delete**, and **View** user data. It uses basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations along with a simple **server setup** to handle HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Add User**: Allows adding a new user with details like user name, email, age, and a unique ID.
- **Update User**: Allows updating an existing user's information based on the unique ID.
- **Delete User**: Allows deleting a user by their unique ID.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Features buttons and forms with hover effects for better user experience.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **In-memory Storage (Array)**: Users' data is stored in a simple array for this project. In a production environment, you would use a database like **MongoDB** or **MySQL**.
- **Body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- **Postman**: Used for testing API endpoints (optional).
